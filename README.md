# B2B SaaS & Marketplace Case Studies

This repository contains anonymised case studies from real-world B2B SaaS and marketplace projects, showcasing practical React/TypeScript solutions, business impact, and technical depth. These materials are intended for recruiters, hiring managers, and anyone interested in my approach to building scalable, business-focused front-end products.
